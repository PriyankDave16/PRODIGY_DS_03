# PRODIGY_DS_03
# Data Preprocessing, Analysis, and Decision Tree Classifier

This repository contains my third task as a Data Science Intern at [Prodigy Infotech](https://www.prodigyinfotech.com/). Building upon foundational data handling, this project focuses on a complete machine learning pipeline: from thorough data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to implementing and evaluating a Decision Tree Classifier.

## Project Overview

The objective of this task is to demonstrate proficiency in preparing data for machine learning models and then applying a classification algorithm. The project workflow typically includes:

1.  **Data Loading and Initial Inspection**: Importing the dataset and understanding its structure.
2.  **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and preparing the data for model training.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gaining insights into the data's distributions, relationships between features, and correlations through various visualizations.
4.  **Decision Tree Classifier Implementation**: Building and training a Decision Tree model.
5.  **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics.

## Files in this Repository

* `task03.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the Python code for data preprocessing, EDA, Decision Tree model implementation, and evaluation.
* `train.csv`: (If using the Titanic or similar dataset) The training dataset.
* `test.csv`: (If using the Titanic or similar dataset) The test dataset.
    *(Please ensure these CSV files are present in the repository if they are used by the notebook. If not, update this section accordingly.)*

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* **Pandas**: For efficient data loading, manipulation, and cleaning.
* **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: For creating informative and insightful data visualizations during EDA.
* **Scikit-learn**: For data preprocessing utilities (e.g., `LabelEncoder`, `StandardScaler` if applicable) and for implementing the `DecisionTreeClassifier`.

## Setup and Installation

To get this project running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git)
    cd YourRepositoryName
    ```
    (Replace `YourUsername` and `YourRepositoryName` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.)

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
    ```

4.  **Obtain the dataset(s):**
    Ensure that the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files (or whatever datasets `task03.ipynb` relies on) are placed in the root directory of your cloned repository. If you're continuing with the Titanic dataset, these are typically available on Kaggle.

5.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook task03.ipynb
    ```
    This command will open the Jupyter Notebook in your web browser, where you can execute the cells to see the entire pipeline from data cleaning to model prediction.

## Usage

Open the `task03.ipynb` notebook in your Jupyter environment. Run through the cells sequentially to observe:

* How raw data is transformed into a clean, model-ready format.
* The insights derived from various exploratory plots.
* The training and evaluation of the Decision Tree Classifier.

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different preprocessing techniques, or adjust the Decision Tree parameters to observe their impact on model performance.
